# AI Components Documentation

This directory contains the AI models and services that power the AIFi platform. These components are deployed off-chain but interact with the blockchain through oracles and APIs.

## Overview

AIFi uses three main AI components:

1. **Risk Assessment Engine** - ML model for credit scoring
2. **Remittance Optimizer** - AI routing for cross-border transfers
3. **Voice Recognition NLP** - Natural Language Processing for voice commands

## Risk Assessment Engine

The Risk Assessment Engine uses machine learning to provide alternative credit scoring for users who may not have traditional credit history but can demonstrate creditworthiness through other data points.

### Model Architecture

- **Model Type**: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (using XGBoost)
- **Features**:
  - Transaction history (volume, frequency, patterns)
  - Social data (with user consent)
  - Device and behavioral data
  - Alternative financial data

### Training Process

1. Initial training on synthetic data
2. Fine-tuning with labeled real-world data
3. Continuous learning from loan performance

### Risk Scoring Output

The model outputs a risk score that is transformed into one of three risk tiers:
- LOW: High confidence in repayment
- MEDIUM: Moderate confidence
- HIGH: Lower confidence, higher interest rates

## Remittance Optimizer

The Remittance Optimizer uses AI to find the most cost-effective and fastest routes for cross-border transfers, considering multiple factors.

### Model Architecture

- **Model Type**: Reinforcement Learning Agent
- **Environment**:
  - Available stablecoin liquidity pools
  - Current exchange rates
  - Gas prices across networks
  - Historical latency data

### Optimization Parameters

- Transaction fee minimization
- Exchange rate optimization
- Speed of settlement
- Reliability of route

### Output

The optimizer returns the recommended:
- Source token
- Destination token
- Intermediary steps (if any)
- Estimated savings compared to traditional methods

## Voice Recognition NLP

The Voice Recognition NLP system enables users to interact with the DeFi platform using natural language in multiple languages.

### Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: Fine-tuned transformer model (BERT-based)
- **Languages Supported**:
  - English
  - Spanish
  - Portuguese

### Processing Pipeline

1. Speech-to-text conversion
2. Intent recognition
3. Entity extraction (amounts, recipients, etc.)
4. Command formulation
5. Smart contract interaction

### Example Commands

- "Send $50 to Maria in Mexico"
- "What's my current balance?"
- "Apply for a loan of 200 DOC"
- "Check my credit score"

## Integration with Smart Contracts

The AI components interact with the blockchain through:

1. **Oracle Services** - For risk assessments
2. **Signed Transactions** - For triggering optimized remittance paths
3. **Command Mapping** - For translating voice commands to contract calls

## Data Privacy and Ethics

- All user data is processed with explicit consent
- Sensitive data is not stored long-term
- Models are regularly audited for bias
- Clear explanations of model decisions are provided

## Development and Deployment

- Models are trained using TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Deployed as serverless functions on AWS Lambda
- API gateway provides secure access
- Models are containerized for consistent deployment
