# AIFi: AI-Powered DeFi Hub on Rootstock

## Project Overview

AIFi is an innovative DeFi platform built on Rootstock that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance financial accessibility throughout Latin America. Our platform combines the security of Bitcoin with AI-powered systems to solve critical challenges in remittances, micro-lending, and financial inclusion.

### Track Selection

**DeFi and Payments**

### Problem Statement

Latin America faces significant barriers to financial inclusion, including:
- High remittance fees (averaging 6.25% according to World Bank data)
- Limited access to credit for the 70% of the population without formal banking history
- Volatile local currencies that erode savings
- Technical complexity that deters adoption by non-technical users

### Our Solution

AIFi addresses these challenges through four AI-powered components:

1. **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**: Machine learning model analyzes alternative data to provide fair credit scoring for underbanked users
2. **Smart Remittance Optimization**: Reinforcement learning algorithm finds the most cost-effective routes for cross-border transfers
3. **Intelligent Stablecoin Strategies**: AI identifies optimal yield strategies to protect against inflation
4. **Voice-Based Interface**: Natural language processing enables interaction with DeFi services in Spanish and Portuguese

## Technical Architecture

AIFi is built on Rootstock's Bitcoin sidechain, leveraging:
- Smart contract capabilities with EVM compatibility
- Low gas fees (50x cheaper than Ethereum)
- Bitcoin security through merge mining (secured by 60%+ of Bitcoin hash power)
- Integration with regional stablecoins like DOC and BRZ

### Smart Contracts

Our platform consists of four main smart contracts:

1. **AIFiLendingPool.sol**: Lending protocol with dynamic interest rates based on AI risk assessment
2. **AIRiskOracle.sol**: Oracle contract that interfaces with off-chain AI credit scoring model
3. **AIFiRemittance.sol**: Cross-border transfer system with corridor-specific optimization
4. **AIFiVoiceInterface.sol**: Registry for NLP-processed voice commands to interact with contracts

### AI Components

Our off-chain AI architecture includes:

1. **Risk Assessment Engine**:
   - XGBoost model trained on alternative financial data
   - Features include transaction patterns, device usage, and behavioral metrics
   - Outputs risk tier (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) that determines loan terms

2. **Remittance Optimizer**:
   - Graph-based reinforcement learning model
   - Finds optimal paths through stablecoin pairs
   - Considers exchange rates, liquidity, gas costs and transaction time
   - Reduces fees by up to 90% compared to traditional services

3. **Voice Recognition NLP**:
   - Multilingual transformer model for intent classification
   - Named entity recognition for parameter extraction
   - Supports natural commands in English, Spanish, and Portuguese
   - Converts voice inputs to blockchain transactions

## Impact and Innovation

AIFi demonstrates how AI can make blockchain more accessible and useful for real-world problems:

- **Financial Inclusion**: Alternative credit scoring enables access for the 70% of Latin Americans without traditional banking history
- **Cost Savings**: Our remittance optimization reduces fees from 6.25% to as low as 0.5%
- **Accessibility**: Voice commands remove technical barriers, enabling use by non-technical users
- **Regional Focus**: Support for local languages and regional stablecoins addresses specific Latin American needs

## AI Process Documentation

Our team used AI extensively throughout the development process:

### 1. Smart Contract Design

We used generative AI to help design our smart contract architecture. For example, we prompted:

```
Design a solidity smart contract for a lending pool that integrates with an AI-driven risk assessment oracle. The contract should:
1. Allow users to deposit funds
2. Allow users to borrow funds based on their risk tier determined by the AI oracle
3. Have different interest rates for different risk tiers (low, medium, high)
4. Include proper security measures and access controls
```

This accelerated our development by providing a solid foundation that we could then customize and enhance.

### 2. ML Model Development

We leveraged AI to help design our machine learning models. For the remittance optimizer, we used a prompt like:

```
Design an algorithm that finds the optimal path for cross-border remittances across multiple stablecoins and liquidity pools. The algorithm should:
1. Consider exchange rates, liquidity, gas fees, and transaction times
2. Support multiple optimization priorities (lowest fee, fastest time, or balanced)
3. Calculate the expected savings compared to traditional remittance services
4. Learn from historical performance

Use a graph-based approach where nodes are tokens and edges represent conversion paths.
```

This guidance helped us implement an efficient solution using a graph-based reinforcement learning approach.

### 3. Code Generation and Optimization

We used AI to accelerate code writing, particularly for boilerplate components. For example, we generated regex patterns for voice command parsing with a prompt like:

```
Create regex patterns for extracting parameters from voice commands in English, Spanish, and Portuguese for the following intents:
1. Sending money (amount, token, recipient, destination country)
2. Checking balances (token)
3. Applying for loans (amount, token)
4. Depositing funds (amount, token)

The patterns should be robust to different phrasings and word orders in each language.
```

### 4. Testing and Security

We also leveraged AI to generate comprehensive test cases and identify potential security vulnerabilities:

```
Generate comprehensive unit tests for the AIFiLendingPool contract. Tests should cover:
1. Deposit and withdrawal functionality
2. Borrowing based on different risk tiers
3. Interest calculation
4. Edge cases and potential vulnerabilities
5. Access control

Use Hardhat and ethers.js for the test suite.
```

## Conclusion

AIFi represents the future of DeFi on Bitcoin - one where artificial intelligence makes powerful financial tools accessible to everyone, regardless of technical knowledge or banking history. By building on Rootstock, we leverage the security of Bitcoin while creating a user experience that meets real human needs.
