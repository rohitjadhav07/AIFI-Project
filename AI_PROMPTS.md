## Smart Contract Design

### Prompt 1: Initial Contract Architecture

```json
{
  "prompt": "Design a solidity smart contract for a lending pool that integrates with an AI-driven risk assessment oracle. The contract should:\n1. Allow users to deposit funds\n2. Allow users to borrow funds based on their risk tier determined by the AI oracle\n3. Have different interest rates for different risk tiers (low, medium, high)\n4. Include proper security measures and access controls\n\nMake sure the contract is well-documented and follows best practices.",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Developing DeFi contracts for the Rootstock blockchain"
}
```

This prompt helped us establish the initial architecture for our AIFiLendingPool contract, ensuring a solid foundation that integrates AI risk assessment.

### Prompt 2: Remittance Contract Design

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a smart contract for cross-border remittances on Rootstock that:\n1. Supports multiple stablecoins (DOC, RDOC, USDT, DAI, BRZ)\n2. Has configurable fees per corridor (e.g. USA to Mexico, Spain to Colombia)\n3. Includes recipient identification and verification\n4. Has a treasury for fee collection\n\nThe contract should be gas-efficient and well-documented.",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Latin American remittance use cases"
}
```

This prompt helped us design the AIFiRemittance contract with a focus on the specific needs of Latin American countries.

### Prompt 3: Voice Interface Contract

```json
{
  "prompt": "Design a smart contract that maps natural language voice commands to function calls in other contracts. The contract should:\n1. Register and manage command patterns in multiple languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese)\n2. Map commands to target contracts and function selectors\n3. Include access controls for authorized processors\n4. Support adding new languages and commands\n\nThe goal is to create a registry for NLP-processed voice commands that can trigger blockchain transactions.",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Voice-controlled DeFi interface for users with limited technical knowledge"
}
```

This prompt helped us create the AIFiVoiceInterface contract that bridges natural language processing with blockchain transactions.

## Risk Assessment Model

### Prompt 1: Alternative Credit Scoring Features

```json
{
  "prompt": "What features should an AI model consider for alternative credit scoring in Latin America, where many users don't have traditional banking history? Consider data that might be available from smartphones, transaction patterns, and other sources that could predict creditworthiness while respecting privacy.",
  "temperature": 0.8,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Building ML models for credit risk assessment in regions with low financial inclusion"
}
```

This prompt helped us identify key features for our credit scoring model that are relevant to underbanked populations.

### Prompt 2: XGBoost Implementation

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a Python implementation of an XGBoost model for credit risk assessment that:\n1. Takes in transaction history, behavioral data, and alternative financial data\n2. Outputs a risk tier (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)\n3. Includes proper data preprocessing and validation\n4. Connects to a blockchain oracle to update risk tiers on-chain\n\nThe code should be well-structured, documented, and follow best practices for ML model deployment.",
  "temperature": 0.6,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Implementation details for connecting ML models to blockchain oracles"
}
```

This prompt generated the initial version of our risk assessment model, which we further refined and expanded.

## Remittance Optimization

### Prompt 1: Optimal Path Algorithm

```json
{
  "prompt": "Design an algorithm that finds the optimal path for cross-border remittances across multiple stablecoins and liquidity pools. The algorithm should:\n1. Consider exchange rates, liquidity, gas fees, and transaction times\n2. Support multiple optimization priorities (lowest fee, fastest time, or balanced)\n3. Calculate the expected savings compared to traditional remittance services\n4. Learn from historical performance\n\nUse a graph-based approach where nodes are tokens and edges represent conversion paths.",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Optimizing DeFi routing for cross-border transfers"
}
```

This prompt helped us design the core algorithm for our remittance optimization engine.

### Prompt 2: Market Data Integration

```json
{
  "prompt": "How should we structure the code to fetch and update market data (exchange rates, liquidity, gas prices) for our remittance optimization algorithm? Consider:\n1. Different data sources (DEX APIs, price oracles, on-chain data)\n2. Update frequency and caching strategies\n3. Fallback mechanisms if primary sources are unavailable\n4. Data normalization across different sources",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Real-time data integration for blockchain applications"
}
```

This prompt guided our approach to integrating market data in the remittance optimizer.

## Voice Recognition System

### Prompt 1: NLP Pipeline Design

```json
{
  "prompt": "Design a natural language processing pipeline for a DeFi voice interface that:\n1. Detects language (English, Spanish, Portuguese)\n2. Classifies user intent (send money, check balance, get loan, etc.)\n3. Extracts parameters (amount, recipient, token, etc.)\n4. Maps to blockchain functions\n\nThe system should be robust to variations in phrasing and accents common in Latin America.",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Voice interface for blockchain applications in Latin America"
}
```

This prompt helped us design the overall NLP pipeline architecture for our voice recognition system.

### Prompt 2: Intent Classification Model

```json
{
  "prompt": "What transformer model architecture would work best for intent classification in a multilingual DeFi voice interface? The model needs to understand financial terminology in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, and correctly classify user intentions like 'send money', 'check balance', etc. Include specific pre-trained models we could fine-tune and the training approach.",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "context": "Multilingual NLP for financial applications"
