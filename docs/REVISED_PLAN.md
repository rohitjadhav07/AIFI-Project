# Revised AIFi Project Completion Plan

This document outlines the revised steps to complete the AIFi project, addressing the issues encountered during the initial deployment.

## 1. Smart Contract Deployment

### Issue: Token Deployment Failed
The test token deployment failed with status 0, likely due to gas limit issues.

### Solution Steps:
1. Deploy the simplified AIFiToken contract:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-token.js --network testnet
   ```
   - This uses a simpler ERC20 implementation with OpenZeppelin
   - Includes explicit gas limits and lower gas price

2. Verify the token contract:
   ```
   npx hardhat verify --network testnet <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
   ```

3. Update the token records in both lending and remittance contracts.

## 2. AI Model Setup

### Issue: Missing requirements.txt file
The AI directory lacks a requirements.txt file for dependency installation.

### Solution Steps:
1. We've created a requirements.txt file with necessary dependencies:
   ```
   cd ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the setup script for AI models:
   ```
   cd ai
   python setup_ai_models.py
   ```
   - This creates individualized environment files for each AI model
   - Sets up connections to the deployed contracts

3. Create models directory for trained models:
   ```
   mkdir -p ai/models
   ```

## 3. Frontend Development

### Issue: Frontend structure needs organization
The frontend needs proper component organization and contract integration.

### Solution Steps:
1. Organize the frontend structure (directories created):
   ```
   frontend/
   ├── pages/
   ├── components/
   ├── public/
   └── styles/
   ```

2. Create contract interface utilities:
   ```
   mkdir -p frontend/utils
   ```
   - Create `frontend/utils/contracts.js` to handle contract interactions
   - Set up contract ABIs from artifacts folder

3. Start frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## 4. Integration Testing

### Steps:
1. Test basic smart contract interactions:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network testnet
   ```

2. Test AI model connections to contracts:
   ```
   cd ai
   python test_integration.py
   ```

3. Test frontend components with contract integration:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run test
   ```

## 5. Documentation

### Steps:
1. Complete user documentation (created `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`):
   - Update with screenshots once frontend is ready
   - Add specific instructions for each feature

2. Create developer documentation:
   ```
   touch docs/DEVELOPER.md
   ```
   - Document contract architecture
   - Explain AI model integration

3. Update README with latest project status (updated)

## 6. Submission Preparation

### Steps:
1. Prepare a demo video:
   - Record a 3-5 minute demonstration
   - Show contract deployment, UI interactions, and AI integration

2. Update `SUBMISSION.md` with complete project details:
   ```
   touch SUBMISSION.md
   ```
   - Include all deployed contract addresses
   - Highlight innovative AI integration aspects
   - Provide clear testing instructions

3. Final code cleanup:
   - Add comments to all smart contracts
   - Ensure proper error handling in AI models
   - Verify responsive design in frontend

## Timeline

1. **Day 1**: Fix contract deployment issues and deploy token
2. **Day 2**: Complete AI model setup and integration
3. **Day 3**: Finish frontend development and UI components
4. **Day 4**: Conduct integration testing and bug fixes
5. **Day 5**: Finalize documentation and prepare submission
